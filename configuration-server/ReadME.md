### What is Spring Cloud Config Server?
Spring Cloud Config is Spring's client/server approach for storing and serving distributed configurations
across multiple applications and environments. This configuration store is ideally versioned under Git 
version control and can be modified at application runtime. While it fit very well in Spring application 
using all the supported configuration file formats together with constructs like Environmen, PropertySource, 
or @Value, it can be used in any environment running any programming language.
